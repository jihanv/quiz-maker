//receive passage
//count how many words there are
//divide the passage into sections depending on how many words there are
//make an array, difficultWords,  of objects that contain number, word, part of speech of that word, and a blank which will be filled in with a number later on
//in each section, select the most difficult word and replace it with a number that is based on which part it was in (so in the first section, put 1, if word was in second section, put 2, etc). insert that word in array of difficultWords created earlier.
//after going through all the sections, look at the array. then assign a random number between 1 to the number of words there are in the difficultWords
